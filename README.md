# duke-dock
Cross-Platform, All-in-one dev toolkit

## What is it?
DukeDock is the culmination of all of those times that I've said to myself, "damnm, I should write a tool to do this for me". 
I.e. this is a work project with the sole aim of making development smoother/easier by helping you to never take your hand of the keyboard.

The key focus of this app is user experience and efficiency.

Currently devloping on MaxOS so most features will be OSX focussed, but more general purpose features will be added over time.

## Usage Information
Upon installtion, a hidden window will be loaded which can be displayyed by pressing (Windows: WIN + SHIFT + O) (MAC: SHIFT + META + O).
You can then click the button to access which ever feature you would like OR press the relevent keyboard shortcut.

## Current Features
- OTP (Press 1) (Coming Soon)
- StringStore (Press 2) (Mostly in place)
  - Store any string with a name and quickly and easily copy it to your clipboard 
  - Add new records, edit or delete existing records

## Planned Features
- New Guid Generator (Bindable to a Keyboard shortcut that populates your clipboard)
- RSA Key Generator 
- Bind any feature to any key combination
- Random password generator (which can automatically store in the StringStore)
- Bind CMD/Bash statement/s to a key-bind

## Contributions
Contributions are MORE than welcome, be it in the form of PRs with bug fixes/new features/translations.
I only ask that ease of use is maintained/considered. 

If you would like to make a suggestion for features to add, simply PR
